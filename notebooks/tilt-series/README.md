# Determining 3D coordinates of voids through tracking

These series of notebooks illustrate how to use our defect labeling software
along with tracking algorithms and computational geometry to determine
the distribution of voids in three dimensions.

> TODO (wardlt): Run this with both of the sources of tilt-series data
